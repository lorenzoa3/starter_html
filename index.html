            <p>Mini is a 10 year old yorkshire terrier who’s grown up along with me. She enjoys playing and taking baths and is the sweetest dog you could ask for. My mom brought her from a shelter in Ecuador when she was just a couple of months old and even though it was over ten years ago, I remember that day like it was yesterday.</p>

            <p>Mini’s quite small, even smaller than the average yorki so she’s quite sensitive physically speaking. However, she still tries to protect our home when she hears a stranger at the door despite her size. Mini loves her family and has a big heart!</p>
